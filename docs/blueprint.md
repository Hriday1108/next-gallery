## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL 220, 60%, 50% (RGB hex #337AB7), a classic blue that inspires trust and professionalism, suitable for a tool meant to assist in the workplace.
- Background color: HSL 220, 20%, 95% (RGB hex #F2F4F7), a very light tint of blue that gives a sense of space.
- Accent color: HSL 190, 60%, 50% (RGB hex #33A3B7), an analogous blue-green which feels contemporary, and provides the necessary contrast for visual interest.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look suitable for the headings or body text.
- Use simple, modern icons from a library like FontAwesome or Material Icons for task statuses (in progress, completed, etc.) and priority levels.
- Clean, card-based layout for individual tasks with clear separation and visual hierarchy. Prioritize important information such as task description and priority.
- Subtle transition animations when updating task statuses or changing priorities.
